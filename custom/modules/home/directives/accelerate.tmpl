            <p>
                Getting applications on the cloud has been unnecessarily complex, as current technologies only partially
                address these challenges. Before your application teams can focus on coding, DevOps, CloudOps, and Security
                must translate their architectures and policies into cloud environments, by integrating and harmonizing
                infrastructures, frameworks, legacy software, and more — and must build cohesive development, release,
                operating, and management flows and views. Today this IT Plumbing is being developed manually – tying
                down scarce, but critical, expertise and skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                SOAJS single-pane-of-glass (SPOG) management solution automates this IT Plumbing and optimizes
                the development lifecycle for your Applications. DevOps, CloudOps, and Security retain the same level of
                control, with an open, plug-and-play platform that adapts to their vision. With no IT Plumbing coding
                necessary, their critical expertise and skills get leveraged more efficiently, across more projects.
                And your application teams start delivering microservices significantly earlier and faster.
